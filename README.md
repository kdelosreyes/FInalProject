I have heard several complaints from workers of all sorts of industries about having to waste time walking to and from or waiting in line at the clock in/clock out machine. I want to try and save some of that time by creating a way for workers to clock in and out without needing to be in one designated location. My idea is to create a mobile app that allows workers to utilize the fingerprint scanner as their ID input; they would just tap it to sign in and out. However, using only a touch sensor may lead to some faulty clock in's, so I input a sensor (bluetooth beacon for final product, distance sensors for prototype) that makes it so that the workers can only clock in/out, in certain locations. For example, a chef cannot use his touch sensor until he is in the kitchen, and a cubicle worker cannot clock back in until he is within 20 feet of his cubicle.
I would like to execute the app in the future, but for this project I just worked on the prototype. I utilized two distance sensors to mock two different rooms, and one fingerprint scanner.
